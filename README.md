# SURF N'SAIL

Welcome to SURF N'SAIL! A fully functioning booking and marketing website for a Surf School in the South West of Ireland.
What I want to acheive with website is a quick and simple way to book lessons online for a remote surf school with 4 locations.
I kept in mind trying to minimize info to necessary info only as prices, dates and times vary based on weather conditions/numbers of staff and students.. The easiest thing to do is create a funnel for people that would like to attend whatever chosen class at whatever time, the surf school then calls or emails a confirmation message. This saves SURF N'SAIL valuable time organizing lessons and more time in the water.
So instead of taking calls/messages/emails all the time, a large portion of the booking now come from one place.. The SURF N'SAIL website!

The website is designed to bring users to the boking section while giving them the necessary information on the way. The target audience is anyone who is visiting the area looking for some activities and repeat customers. Essentially the website adds order to a rather messy business with calls coming from everywhere and anyone it funnels all classes into a booking form rather than manually booking. The website is also a way to establish the surf school as reputable and to market the latest news and show off previous success.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>What better place to learn to surf than on some of the most beautiful beaches in Ireland?</p>

                <p>Surf N' Sail Surf School runs surf lessons and surf hire at Inch, Banna Beach, Castlegregory, and
                    Brandon Bay in County Kerry. These four beautiful ‘Blue Flag’ beaches are surrounded by the
                    Kerry Mountains and are all popular stops on the Wild Atlantic Way. All of these beaches have
                    been voted the best beach in Ireland by Tripadvisor visitors in recent years. Beauty aside, the
                    consistency of the surf makes these beaches ideal places to take a surf lesson.</p>

                <p>Inch Beach, located on the Dingle Peninsula, is one of the most famous beaches in Ireland and is
                    only 20 minutes from Dingle town. It is also part of the Reeks District.</p> <br>
                <p> Banna Beach is only 15 minutes from Tralee. From Killarney, Inch and Banna Beach are around a
                    40-minute drive.</p>

                <p>Castlegregory and Brandon Bay are also fantastic spots for surfing, offering stunning views and
                    excellent waves. Castlegregory is known for its long stretches of sandy beach, making it perfect
                    for both beginners and advanced surfers. Brandon Bay is another gem on the Kerry coastline,
                    offering diverse surfing conditions suitable for all levels.</p>

                <p>If you are not taking a surf lesson with us but have your own equipment, there are plenty of
                    other surf spots around the Kerry coastline for you to explore.</p>

                <p>We also rent/hire surfboards and wetsuits at Inch, Banna Beach, Castlegregory, and Brandon Bay,
                    so as long as you know what you are doing, you are welcome to rent a surfboard and wetsuit from
                    our large stock of boards. We have all different shapes and sizes!</p>

                <p>Get in touch via our contact page, or phone us at 001-01100111.</p>

                <p>We look forward to seeing you on the waves!</p>
